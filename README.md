# My website
#### Hello, this is my website. I made it for fun and to learn web development. Here are some things about it:

- I used HTML and CSS to make the website. **I did not use any frameworks or templates.**
- **I designed the images and icons by myself** in Inkscape. But I used Font Awesome for the social media and hamburger menu icons.
- However, **I got help from Bing chat and ChatGPT to write the JavaScript code.**

I hope you enjoy my website. You can contact me if you want to say something or ask something. Thanks for visiting!
