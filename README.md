# My website
#### This is my website. I made this site for fun, and to learn web development along the way.

- I built this site from scratch using HTML, CSS and JS. **I did not use any frameworks, libraries or templates.**
- **I designed the images and icons by myself** in Inkscape. But I used [Iconify.Design](https://iconify.design/) for the social media and hamburger menu icons.
- However, **I got help from Bing chat and ChatGPT to write the JavaScript code.**
- Also, I adapted some codes for some elements from the w3schools, such as [Tooltip](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_tooltip.asp) and [Toggle Switch](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp), and modified them to suit my website design and functionality.

I hope you enjoy my website.
